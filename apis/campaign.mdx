# Recruitment Campaign API

The Recruitment Campaign API manages the complete lifecycle of hiring campaigns — including creation, updating, viewing, deleting and fetching statistics. It also connects campaigns with candidate workflows such as screening, pre-screening forms, interview notes, and client notes. This API acts as the central hub that links profiles, candidates, interviews, and evaluation processes across the RMS.
