# Interview Schedule Workflow

The Interview Schedule module is used to plan, organize, and track interviews for candidates who are shortlisted from a recruitment campaign. It helps recruiters manage interview timings, interviewer assignments, meeting links, communication, and interview outcomes (Select/Reject), all in one place. It acts as the time-based hub of the recruitment pipeline.

## **Candidate Reaches Interview Stage**

A candidate is shortlisted from the **Candidate Tracker** after pre-screening or CV review.\
From there, the recruiter proceeds to schedule their interview from the Interview Schedule page.

## **Create Interview Flow (Main Workflow)**

### **Step 1 — Open “New Interview Schedule”**

The recruiter clicks the button to schedule an interview.\
If coming from Candidate Tracker, candidate/campaign fields are pre-filled.

### **Step 2 — Select Campaign**

All active recruitment campaigns are listed.\
Selecting one loads all its shortlisted candidates.

### **Step 3 — Select Candidate for Interview**

Only shortlisted candidates from the selected campaign are shown.\
Recruiter chooses whom the interview is for.

### **Step 4 — Select Interviewer**

Recruiter selects either a human interviewer or the “AI Interviewer.”

### **Step 5 — Add Interview Details**

Recruiter enters:

- Interview name (ex: “L1 Interview – Arjun Mehta”)
- Date
- Time (From & To)
- Location / Meeting link
- Candidate email/phone
- Interviewer email
- Interview mode (Online / In-person)

If AI Interviewer is selected, the AI meeting link and setup are auto-generated.

## **Sending Interview Notification**

Once sent, the UI shows **Notification Sent**.

## **Adding Interview Notes**

During or after the interview:

- Recruiter writes notes
- Notes are saved
- Notes automatically appear inside **Candidate Tracker → L1/L2 Interview Notes tab**

This ensures all interview stages stay synchronized.

## **Selecting the Candidate (Move to Next Round)**

When the recruiter clicks **Select**:

- Interview notes are saved
- Candidate’s stage is updated (L1 completed → moves to L2, or L2 completed → final stage)
- Candidate appears in the next round in **Candidate Tracker**

This is how the candidate moves through the pipeline.

## **Rejecting the Candidate**

When recruiter clicks **Reject**:

- A rejection email is sent to the candidate
- Interview is marked completed
- Candidate status becomes **Rejected**
- Candidate moves to the Rejected bucket in Candidate Tracker

This closes the candidate's interview flow.

## **Search & Filter Workflow**

### **Search Bar**

Recruiters can search interviews by:

- Candidate name
- Interview schedule name
- Interviewer name
- Campaign name
- Status (Scheduled, Pending, Completed)
- Date/time
- Meeting link/location

### **Interviewer View Filtering**

If the logged-in user has the role _Interviewer_:

- They only see interviews assigned to them
- This ensures privacy and reduces clutter

## **Summary**

The Interview Schedule module manages the entire lifecycle of interviews:

- Candidates shortlisted →
- Interviews created →
- Notifications sent →
- Notes recorded →
- Candidate moved to next stage or rejected

It seamlessly synchronizes with the **Candidate Tracker**, ensuring the recruiter maintains a clear, structured flow from L1 → L2 → Final selection.

This module keeps all interview operations centralized, streamlined, and audit-friendly for the entire recruitment cycle.
