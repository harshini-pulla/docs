# Candidate Tracker Workflow

The Candidate Tracker manages the entire lifecycle of a candidate inside a recruitment campaign — from pre-screening to final verification. Recruiters review form responses, conduct L1/L2 interviews with AI insights, collect client notes, and verify documents or employment gaps. It acts as the central hub where every action, status, and progress of a candidate is tracked in one place.

## **Candidate Shortlisting Phase**
