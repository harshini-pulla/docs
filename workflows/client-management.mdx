## How It Fits With Other Modules

### **JD Creation**

- Company dropdown is populated from Client Master
- Selecting a client **auto-fills the company email**

### **Campaign Creation**

- Campaign inherits company name/email from Client Master if missing

### **Profile Articulation**

- If JD has no companyEmail → fallback to Client Master

## Summary

Client Master is the **central directory of all client companies**.  
All JDs, Campaigns, Positions, and Profiles depend on this module to ensure consistent and accurate company data across the RMS.
