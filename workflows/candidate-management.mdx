# **Candidate Profile – Workflow**

The Candidate Profile module manages every candidate’s complete information—from personal details and resume to professional history and URS (Universal Resume Schema).\
It acts as the **central hub** for candidate data before they enter a Recruitment Campaign pipeline.\
Once a candidate is shortlisted, they move into the **Candidate Tracker**, where all hiring stages occur.

## Workflow 

The Candidate Profile workflow covers **everything from creation → screening → pipeline movement**, ensuring recruiters have complete control over the candidate’s lifecycle.

### **Candidate Creation**

A recruiter starts by selecting a Recruitment Campaign and then filling in:

- Personal details: name, email, phone, location
- Professional information: skills, experience, expected salary
- Resume upload (PDF/DOC/DOCX/TXT)
- Automatic resume parsing (optional)
- Social links & employment history
- Profile picture (optional)

After saving, the candidate becomes part of the global pool visible under **Candidate Profile**.

### **Candidate Viewing (Detailed Dashboard View)**

Clicking a candidate opens a complete 360° view:

- Contact & personal info
- Professional info (skills, experience, salary)
- Application timeline
- Resume information (View / Download)
- Universal Resume Schema (URS) & Deep Research AI insights
- Social profiles
- Employment history

From this page, recruiters can:

- Preview or download resume
- Open Deep Research
- Shortlist into a campaign
- Edit details
- Delete candidate

### **Candidate Editing**

Recruiters may update:

- Contact details
- Professional info
- Resume upload (re-upload allowed)
- Status (Application → Shortlisted → Interview → Rejected, etc.)
- Confirmation email status
- Campaign association

The system ensures RBAC-based permissions for all edits.

### **Candidate Shortlisting**

Shortlisting is the crucial turning point of the workflow:

When a recruiter clicks **Shortlist**:

- The candidate is attached to the selected Recruitment Campaign
- The candidate instantly appears inside that **Campaign's Candidate Tracker**
- All next processes occur _inside the Campaign Tracker_:
  - Pre-screening form responses
  - CV improvements
  - L1 & L2 Interview Notes
  - AI Transcript insights
  - Employment gap analysis
  - Document & certificate verification
  - Client notes
  - Offer or rejection handling

This bridges **Candidate Profile → Recruitment Campaign workflow**.

### **Candidate Deletion**

Deleting removes:

- Candidate profile
- CV reference
- URS reference
- Campaign linkage
- Associated S3 file keys (if enabled)

Only permitted roles can delete candidates.

## **Search & Filter Behavior**

The Candidate Profile page includes a powerful search bar:

### **You can search by:**

- Candidate name
- Email
- Phone
- Skills
- Campaign name
- Status (Shortlisted, Rejected, etc.)
- JD/role code
- Experience keywords

Search is **client-side filtered**, applied on top of the fetched candidate list.

## Summary 

The Candidate Profile module serves as the **master record** for every applicant in the RMS.\
It allows recruiters to create, update, validate, and manage all candidate information in one place.\
After shortlisting, candidates move into the **Candidate Tracker**, where screening, interviews, verification, and client reviews occur.\
This module ensures a clean separation between **candidate data storage** and **campaign hiring workflow**, making the entire system scalable, trackable, and easy for recruiters to manage.
