# **Candidate Profile – Workflow**

The Candidate Profile module manages every candidate’s complete information—from personal details and resume to professional history and URS (Universal Resume Schema).\
It acts as the **central hub** for candidate data before they enter a Recruitment Campaign pipeline.\
Once a candidate is shortlisted, they move into the **Candidate Tracker**, where all hiring stages occur.

## **Summary**

The Candidate Profile module is the **master record** for every applicant in the RMS.  
It allows recruiters to create, update, validate, and manage candidate information in one place.  
After shortlisting, candidates move into **Candidate Tracker** for screening, interviews, verification, and client review.  
It ensures a clean separation between **candidate data storage** and **campaign hiring workflow**, making the system scalable, trackable, and easy for recruiters to manage.
