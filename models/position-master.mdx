# **Position Master**

Position Master stores all standardized job positions and their industries in one central list.\
It ensures consistent job titles across the RMS and prevents free-text variations.\
Other modules like Target Company Master use this list to assign relevant roles.\
This helps recruitment and BD teams stay aligned on the exact positions they target or hire for.
