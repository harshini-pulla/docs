# **Organization Model**

The **Organization** model represents a company or business unit inside the RMS.\
Users can create multiple organizations, but **only one organization can be active at a time**.

This is used to control:

- Which organization’s data the user is currently working with
- Access permissions
- Job postings, campaigns, candidates, etc.

## **Fields**

| Field       | Type    | Description                         |
| :---------- | :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `name`      | String  | Name of the organization            |
| `status`    | Boolean | `true` = Active, `false` = Inactive |
| `createdAt` | Date    | Timestamp                           |
| `updatedAt` | Date    | Timestamp                           |

## **Functionalities**

### Add Organization

The admin can create a new organization by entering its name and logo.

### Edit Organization

Name and logo can be updated anytime.

### Delete Organization

An organization can be removed, provided it is not currently active.

### Activate Organization

Only **one** organization can be active at a time.\
When the admin toggles an organization to “Active”:

- The previously active organization automatically becomes inactive
- All dashboards and data views switch to the active organization context

## **UI Behavior **

- Total organizations displayed at the top
- Active count and inactive count shown
- Organization list with:
  - Logo initials (AP, MS)
  - Status toggle (Active/Inactive)
  - Edit button
  - Delete button
- Search bar to filter organizations

## **Where this model is used?**

- **Dashboard** (shows selected org data)
- **User Management**
- **JD Creation**
- **Client Master**
- **Candidate Profile**
- **Interview Scheduling**

Everything depends on the selected active organization.
