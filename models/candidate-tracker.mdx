# Candidate Tracker

The **Candidate Tracker** is the core of the RMS recruitment workflow. It provides a complete 360° view of every candidate inside a Recruitment Campaign, covering screening, interviews, document verification, AI evaluations, and client feedback.

This module is the **heart of RMS**, where recruiters manage the entire candidate journey from first interaction to final shortlisting.

## Candidate Tracker – Model Overview

Each candidate within a campaign stores:

- Pre-screening responses
- CV improvement suggestions
- Interview notes (L1 + L2)
- AI transcript, summary, action points
- Client notes
- Document verification details
- Verification notes
- Status + Stage updates

These fields are stored across models such as **Candidate**, **InterviewNotes**, **ClientNotes**, and **Verification Data**.
