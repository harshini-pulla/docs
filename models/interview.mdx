# Interview Schedule

The **Interview Schedule module** lets recruiters **plan, manage, and track interviews** for shortlisted candidates.\
It handles creating interview slots, notifying candidates/interviewers, adding interview notes, and updating the candidate’s stage (L1/L2).\
This module acts as the **time-based workflow hub** for all interviews in the recruitment pipeline.

## **Interview Model Description**
